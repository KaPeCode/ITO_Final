      <p>Full-stack developer building web apps.</p>
      <p>I've always been fascinated by logic, problem-solving, and how computers work. Although my career initially took me in a different direction, I never lost that curiosity. Recently, I made the decision to follow my passion and dive fully into web development. Iâ€™ve just completed a full-stack development course, and I'm excited to apply my skills to real-world projects while continuing to learn and grow in this dynamic field.</p>
